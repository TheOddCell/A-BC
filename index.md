# A:BC
A website that opens a custom about:blank page

A:BC works using javascript, and could be used to create pranks like "look at my new domain" when you are just super cheap.

An example can be shown at [example.html](/example.html). [(code on github here)](https://github.com/TheOddCell/A-BC/blob/main/example.html)
